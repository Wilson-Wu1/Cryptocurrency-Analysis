## How to Run Programs

### Neural Net
...

### Run correlation.py
Required Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, sys, matplotlib, pathlib, scipy.stats

This program requires the coins .csv files to be located in the same directory level as the program.

Run the program by executing "python correlation.py" in the terminal.
Both the heatmap and bitcoin correlation visuals will be saved as jpgs.

Please note that the bitcoin correlation graph will also show when running the program. This is because the x-label is cut-off while saving it as a figure.

### Run precent_change.py
Required Libraries: Pandas, sys, matplotlib, pathlib, scipy.stats

This program requires the coins .csv files to be located in the same directory level as the program.

Run the program by executing "python percent_change.py [firstCoin] [secondCoin]" in the terminal. Ensure to indicate the two coins that are desired as sys arguments.

Example: >python percent_change.py bitcoin polkadot

The visuals will be saved as .jpgs.
